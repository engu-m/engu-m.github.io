## Introduction

After a movie, my first question always is: "Are the main actors really famous?" and sometimes "Did this pair play in other movies?". To answer these questions, I created an interactive co-stardom network.

The project is [live](https://actor-network-enguerrand-monard.koyeb.app/), have a try!

## Description

The graph is interactive. Two actors are connected in the network if they both played in at least one movie.

	<figcaption>A screenshot of what the network looks like. Two actors were added: Emma Stone and Brad Pitt. We can visually identify the few actors who played with both of them. The view is filtered on Ryan Gosling. As he is selected, as well as his relationships with the other two, we get more insight in the bottom right panel.</figcaption>

### Adding actors

Either search for your favorite actor in the appropriate input field and click [Add](#){: .btn .btn--success}, or hit <i class = "fa fa-dice"></i> to add a random actor.

### Selecting actors/relationships

You can click and drag nodes and edges anywhere. A selected node will appear in red and a selected edge in black. Selecting a node reveals the number of connections the actor currently has in the graph, as well as basic personal information on the actor/actress. Selecting an edge reveals the common movies these two actors have. You can select simultaneously multiple nodes and edges with <kbd>Ctrl/Cmd+click</kbd> or with a click and drag rectangle box selection while holding <kbd>Ctrl/Cmd</kbd>.

### Removing actors

Hit <i class="fa fa-times"></i> to remove everbody from the graph.

Hit <i class="fa fa-trash"></i> to remove the selected actors (those in red).

Hit <i class="fa fa-broom"></i> to clear actors with no relationships in the network.

Alternatively, you can type the actor's name in the appropriate input field and hit [Remove](#){: .btn .btn--danger}.

Instead of removing an actor, you can filter the view more easily with the automatic filtering text input <i class="fa fa-filter"></i>.


## Data source

*[tsv]: tab-separated value

One major concern is to get a reliable source of data. [IMDb](https://developer.imdb.com/non-commercial-datasets/) provides non-commercial datasets for everyone to use on the form of huge tsv files. For our purpose, we will look at three of these files : `title_basics.tsv`, `name_basics.tsv`, `title_principals.tsv`. These contain respectively : the list of all movies, the list of all actors and the list of casts, i.e. for every impersonation of one actor in a single movie the list of all characters.

The following tables show the first few lines of these files.

Actors are uniquely identified by the `nconst` id, while movies are identified with the `tconst` id. The first two tables provide basic information, while the third one links the two identifiers.

## Design choices

### Database management system

My first thought was to migrate these files to a SQL database because the data is well structured. Unfortunately, I was not able to create a [PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org) database on my machine ðŸ’€. This is one of the many issues encountered in real life projects. 

So I switched to a graph-based database called [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com). The advantage of a graph-based database is that the queries would then be written in an almost <i>natural</i> language.
The installation works fine and I was able to define a relational model for the three files to describe the structure of the network. However, the free plan of Neo4j is limited to 200000 nodes, which allows only for a very partial upload of the dataset. Because in this project the completeness of the dataset really matters, I switched to [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com) for its flexibility and ease of use, which allows to store the full dataset in a document-based database.

Going back to a non-graph-based database is not that much of an issue in our case as I only need one single request: "Find all the other actors a single actor ever played with". If I were to ask for more complex queries, such as "Find all the other actors at a distance lower than two of a given actor" or "What is the distance (minimum number of connections in the network) between two actors?", then I would need a graph-based database, as the requests would be absolutely inefficient (and tedious to write) in MongoDB.



### User interface

Displaying the whole network seemed a bit daunting at first. With hundreds of thousands of actors, it would be an intricate mesh of nodes and edges and require tremendous computation power on both client-side on server-side. Moreover, we usually are interested in a small portion of the network, so I let the user add the desired actors on its own.

## Miscellaneous tips and pitfalls

To accelerate requests in MongoDB, it is recommended to use indexes. In my case, they allowed for a times 10 speed-up! This is due to the numerous join (aka `$lookup` in MongoDB) operations performed between the collections.
